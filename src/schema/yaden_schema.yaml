title: Self-Transcendent Experience Scale (STE-S) Assessment Schema
description: >-
  LinkML schema for capturing data from instances of the Self-Transcendent Experience Scale (STE-S).
  The STE-S operationalizes Self-Transcendent Experiences as transient moments of decreased self 
  salience and/or increased feelings of connectedness. Includes State, Trait-Transformative, 
  and Trait-Often versions.
