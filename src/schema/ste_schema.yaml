title: Self-Transcendence Experience (STE) Trait - Often Assessment Schema
description: >-
  LinkML schema for capturing data from an instance of the STE Trait - Often scale.
  This scale assesses how often an individual reports having self-transcendent experiences,
  using a 7-point Likert scale. Items are typically randomized during administration.
